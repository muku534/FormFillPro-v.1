# Privacy Policy for FormFill Pro

**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026

## Our Commitment

FormFill Pro is designed with privacy as the top priority. We believe your data should stay yours, always.

## Data Collection

**We collect ZERO data.** Specifically:

- ✅ No personal information
- ✅ No usage statistics
- ✅ No analytics or tracking
- ✅ No form data collection
- ✅ No telemetry
- ✅ No cookies
- ✅ No external server communication

## How The Extension Works

FormFill Pro operates entirely within your web browser:

1. When you click "Fill Forms", the extension generates fake data locally
2. This fake data is inserted directly into form fields on the current page
3. All processing happens in your browser—nothing is sent to external servers
4. No data persists after you close the browser (unless you save custom templates)

## Local Storage

The extension uses browser local storage only for:

- User preferences (settings you configure)
- Custom templates (if you create them)

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is stored only in your browser
- Can be deleted at any time by removing the extension

## Permissions Explained

FormFill Pro requires certain browser permissions to function:

- **activeTab** - Access the current tab to detect and fill form fields
- **storage** - Store your preferences and templates locally in your browser
- **scripting** - Run scripts that detect form fields and fill them
- **contextMenus** - Add right-click menu options for convenience
- **host_permissions** - Work on any website (because forms exist everywhere)

## Third-Party Services

FormFill Pro does not use any third-party services, APIs, or analytics platforms.

## Open Source

FormFill Pro is open source. You can review the entire codebase to verify our privacy claims:

## Children's Privacy

FormFill Pro does not collect data from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change this policy (we don't expect to), we will update the "Last Updated" date and notify users through the extension.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our GitHub repository:

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Use the extension without providing any personal information
- Delete all extension data by removing the extension from your browser
- Review our source code to verify these privacy claims

**Bottom Line:** FormFill Pro sees your forms, fills them with fake data, and forgets everything. Your real data never touches our code.
